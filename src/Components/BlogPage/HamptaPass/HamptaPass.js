              It was on the 2nd of May when the sun at the east was peeping out
              behind the clouds, and we were waiting for a few to join us. It
              was 9 a.m. on a fresh summer day. They finally arrived and we
              departed, in a train which took us to Dehradun. We then took a bus
              to Sankri. Accompanied by a group of enthusiastic people on the
              bus, we played Truth or dare, bluff, and Mafia with them. Despite
              our expectations, we developed a very good bond at the earliest.
              On the way, in our exciting journey, we were amazed by the scenic
              beauty of the Yamuna river and the wide-spread Pine forests.
              Meanwhile, the bus stopped. YES! We reached Sankri. Our joy bound
              no words. We kept our luggage safe in our base camp and got ready
              fast to start our first summer trek.With no further delay, we all
              began. Our minds were all set with the aim of completing the trek
              within a few hours. Eventually, we felt exhausted during the
              journey and thought to rest.

              But then we realized that we had just finished a single kilometer!
              In Spite of the exhaustion and debilitation, our seniors motivated
              us to keep our spirits high. A part of our team who were playing
              songs was suggested to enjoy vocals and visuals, by a senior,
              instead of using electronics. Meanwhile, one of our friends shared
              a bagful of gummy bears with us, which really helped us to take
              easier breaths at higher altitudes. After climbing planes and
              rocks, we reached a checkpoint-a mesmerizing lake, hidden between
              the snow-covered majestic mountains, offering scenic Himalayan
              landscapes - JUDA KA TALAB. Greeneries around were enhancing the
              grace of Heaven. Nearby the lake, we encountered a hut-like place,
              where we were served hot Maggie to satiate our hunger.

              The location was a semi-snowy ground with green trees around and
              we all worked together to make our tents.Yep! Our tents were ready
              and then it was bonfire time! However, gathering sticks was a
              hectic task. One of the seniors, who had been to almost 10-12
              treks, narrated us horror stories. We were thoroughly enjoying the
              moment with chit-chat commentaries. We then decided to doze off
              under the twinkly sky lit up with a million stars, admiring how
              the Milky Way was spewing its milk across the sky.

              Our next wonderful day started at 4 a.m. We all were up in the
              dawn to catch the glimpse of the serene, spectacular sunrise from
              an altitude of 12,000 ft. After the long admiration, carrying the
              peaceful vibes, we continued on our way to the top of the peak.
              Yeah! We finally did it. We reached a place which is least
              intervened by humans. Our cheerfulness bound no words. Everything
              around was eye-catching. We were admiring each and every moment
              and we clicked lotta pictures there thereby saving those moments.
              We also found a beautiful Lord Shiva idol which added more bliss
              to the place. We worshipped with complete serenity. We were still
              glaring at the vast, widespread mountains. All of us were sunk in
              the awe of the marvelous scenery. After staying there for a long
              while, we decided to descend. We decided to enjoy it to the
              fullest as we were then aware of the path. Few of us slid the
              snowy steeps. It was undoubtedly fun.

              time, we realized that most of us were suffering mild headaches
              and the reason wondered us all because we had crossed 9000 ft !!!
              It was dusk and we decided to camp. The location was a semi-snowy

            and chit-chat mode, sharing our memories with each other which
            multiplied the happiness. Next day of descending started with
            hesitation at dawn because the water was damn cold that none
            literally dared to touch it. We continued the descent. We were
            almost back to the bottom and noticed our tanned skin blaming the
            hot sun. Eventually, it was dusk again and we made our tents ready.
            We engaged our chit-chats with interesting games. We played Uno,
            True or Dare, and a few more. Again our chit-chats continued very
            long that we legit ended the conversation discussed Egyptian
            Mythology. Our trip came to an end and it was time to return back.
            We were cherishing the moments with memories but still were with a
            heavy heart to leave the magnificent place. Those stilled memories
            in cameras and phones will stay evident for our entire lifetime.
            This gist of our Kedar Kantha journey puts us in Nostalgia and YEAH!
            OUR JOURNEY CONTINUES...
